/*
 * PDA
 * Per-cpu private data area for each cpu. The PDA is located immediately after
 * the IA64 cpu_data area. A full page is allocated for the cp_data area for each
 * cpu but only a small amout of the page is actually used. We put the SNIA PDA
 * in the same page as the cpu_data area. Note that there is a check in the setup
 * code to verify that we don't overflow the page.
 *
 * Seems like we should should cache-line align the pda so that any changes in the
 * size of the cpu_data area don't change cache layout. Should we align to 32, 64, 128
 * or 512 boundary. Each has merits. For now, pick 128 but should be revisited later.
